# Real-Time Object Detection with OpenCV and MobileNet SSD

A progressive learning project demonstrating real-time and image-based object detection using OpenCV’s DNN module with MobileNet SSD. The project includes a simple Tkinter GUI to switch between webcam detection and image file detection modes. Perfect for learning computer vision basics and integrating deep learning models step-by-step.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using your webcam.
- Object detection on static images loaded from your computer.
- Bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores.
- Easy-to-use Tkinter GUI for switching between webcam and image detection.
- Progressive design to build your understanding of OpenCV and DNNs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

Install dependencies via pip if you don’t have them:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy

```
## Sample Detection Output
